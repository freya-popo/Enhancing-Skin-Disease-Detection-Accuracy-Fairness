## description:
- Data Analysis: analyzed the imbalance situation of Fitzpatrick17k dataset and predicted classification accuracy using ResNet18 model
- Sampling methods: applied sampling to build 3 models with different imbalance situations, improved the imbalance in accuracy results 
- Data augmentation: applied simple methods (flip, rotate, etc.); applied DCGAN for generating fake images and achieved a more balanced accuracy with 25% improvement while utilizing 30% fewer images
